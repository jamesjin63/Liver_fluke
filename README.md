# Introduction 
Clonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis, caused by the liver flukes Clonorchis sinensis and Opisthorchis viverrini respectively, represent significant neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in Asia. The co-existence of these pathogens in overlapping regions complicates effective disease control strategies. This study aimed to elucidate the  Southeast Asia.![image](https://github.com/jamesjin63/Liver_fluke/assets/16386940/e642fd30-7e34-47ea-b4bd-d5ea4e54e864)
